## Parallel construction and parallel search

using SimilaritySearch
````

Similarity search on very large datasets and high-dimensional datasets require high computational
resources. In this example we show how to parallelize both the construction and search to be able to
handle this kind of databases.

````julia:ex3
const dim = 16

db = MatrixDatabase(randn(Float32, dim, 10^5))
Q = MatrixDatabase(randn(Float32, dim, 30))
dist = SqL2Distance()
G = SearchGraph(; dist, db, verbose=true)
````

The `SearchGraph` construction algorithm is incremental:
- If the index is empty, an element is inserted just inserting it into the index
- If the index is not empty, the element is inserted and connected to its nearest neighbors (looking into the current index)

the parallel construction is made with `index!` or `append_items!`, for this matter these functions accept
a `parallel_block` argument, that controls how many elements are inserted at once, i.e., looking for its nearest neighbors
in parallel and connected also in parallel.

As in the sequential version, a minimum number of elements must exists to work, and therefore, the `parallel_minimum_first_block`
argument can also be specified. By default, it is equal to `parallel_block`.
The `parallel_block` argument should be set to at least the number of available threads, and perhaps multiplying it by
a small constant is also a good approach.

This example didn't run in parallel due to the document generation pipeline but all demonstrations actually do it.
Nonetheless, they ran with the parallel API in single thread mode.

````julia:ex4
index!(G; parallel_block=512)
nothing # hide
````

Note that you can't call `push_item!`, `append_items!`, or `index!` from several threads. The default algorithm will takes
advantage of the multiple threads .

## Searching
Once the index is constructed, you can solve batches in parallel and also single queries.
In contrast with append, these functions can be called in multithreading algorithms.
However, you must pause the searching requests while perform insertions (parallel or sequential).

````julia:ex5
I, D = searchbatch(G, Q, 10)


Threads.@threads for i in eachindex(Q)
    p = search(G, Q[i], KnnResult(10))
    res = p.res

    print("=== $i -- nearest neighbor:")
    println(res[1])
    print("=== $i -- result set:")
    println(collect(res))
    print("=== $i -- identifiers:")
    println(collect(IdView(res))) # do something with `res`
    print("=== $i -- distances:")
    println(collect(DistView(res))) # do something with `res`
end
````

## About searching pools
Searching and also insertion methods (since they also perform searches) make use of several objects that are cached
and reused to reduce memory allocations. These caches are named pools and are of type `SearchGraphPools`, their
default values should be enough for multithreading applications, but special usage will require to review them.
Among the special usages that require an explicit handling of pools we can think on objects indexing objects
that are also indexes, or distance functions that can perform context switches as tasks (?).
