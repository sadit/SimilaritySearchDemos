# This example shows how to perform single queries instead of solving a batch of them.
# This is particularly useful for some applications, and we also show how they are solved,
# which could be used to avoid some memory allocations.

# Suppose you want to compute some $k$ nearest neighbors, for this we use the structure
# `KnnResult` which is a priority queue of maximum size `k`.
res = KnnResult(3) # allocates memory for 10 nearest neighbors
for v in rand(db, 10)
    reuse!(res)  # reuses the res object
    @time search(G, v, res)
    @show minimum(res), maximum(res), argmin(res), argmax(res)
    @show res.id, res.dist
end

# ## `KnnResult`
# This structure is the container for the result and it is also used to specify the number
# of elements to retrieve. As mentioned before, it is a priority queue

@show :popfirst! => popfirst!(res)

@show :pop! => pop!(res)

# It can be iterated
