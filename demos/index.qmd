## List of examples
We separate the examples by the kind of data, since some of the datasets are quite large and will require a lot of computer power. We also list how to connect `SimilaritySearch` with other packages that require solving `k` nearest neighbor queries.

### Synthetic data
- [2d example](syn2d.qmd)

### Numbers and structure
- [Prime factors](primes.qmd)
- [ManifoldLearning -- scurve and prime gaps ](using-manifoldlearning.qmd)

### Natural language processing
- [Glove embeddings](glove.qmd)
- [Emoji space](emojispace.qmd)

### Images
- [MNIST](mnist.qmd)
